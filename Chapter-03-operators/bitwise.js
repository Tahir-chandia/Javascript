// Bitwise Operators

// Bitwise converts the number in to binary number and than give answer

//1. & just like && this work but this time it give answer according to binary

console.log(5 & 6); //4
console.log(2 & 3); //2

//2. | just like || this work but this time it give answer according to binary

console.log(5 | 6); //7
console.log(2 | 3);  //3

//3. ~ just like ! this work but this time it give answer according to binary
console.log(~(5)); // -(x +1) = -6
console.log(~(0)); // -(x +1) = -1
console.log(~(6)); // -(x +1) = -7
console.log(~(2)); // -(x +1) = -3
console.log(~(3)); // -(x +1) = -7
